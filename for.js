// As you complete each challenge, RUN THE CODE to ensure it works. You can do this by
// running `node <filepath>`. If you are in this directory, you'd run `node for.js`.
  
// Challenge 1
// Use a for statement to log to the console all even numbers between 25 and 75.
for (let i = 25; i<75; i++) {
  if (i%2===0) {console.log(i)}
}

// Challenge 2
// Use a for statement to log to the console a complete sentence stating the weather using the Array below:
var weather_options = ["sunny", "snowy", "freezing", "partly cloudy", "drizzly"]
for (item of weather_options) {
  console.log(`Today the weather is ${item}`)
}

// Challenge 3
// Use a for statement to log to the console only the words that are exactly 3 characters in length
var words = ["car", "bike", "bus", "van", "scooter", "truck", "rv"]
for (item of words) {
  if (item.length===3) {console.log(item)}
}


// 📹 Record yourself live-coding and talking through any ONE of the challenges. 
  // The recording doesn't have to be the first time you are solving the problem. 
  // Use technical vocabulary and explain each part to demonstrate your understanding! 
  // Share the link to your video in your small group channel.
