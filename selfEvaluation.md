# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel fairly confident
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I'm familiar with this material. It went okay. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I feel pretty confident with for statements, but I'm sure there are things I don't understand about it yet. 
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
No questions at this time.
